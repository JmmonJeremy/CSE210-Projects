# General Overview of C# Code Demonstrations
I created this to demonstrate the use of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and C# integrated together. The C# code demonstrations are done by Jeremy Troy Suchanski. These demonstrations have been created to be a tool to help others learn code using the C# programming language.
### <ins> Development Environment </ins>

* Visual Studio Code
* Git / GitHub
* C# for Visual Studio Code (v1.25.4) - powered by OmniSharp
* .NET 7.0 SDK (v7.0.203) - Windows x64

# C# Software Projects Organization
### This repository contains C# code for several different software projects. They are arranged as follows:

* **`sandbox`** - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like. <br>
* **`csharp-prep`** - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments. <br>

<ul><b>1) Prep1</b>
<p><ins><b>Overview</b></ins><br>
This is a basic question & response program using C#. I created this to demonstrate the use of the C# functions: Console.WriteLine() to print statements to the terminal and of Console.ReadLine() to capture responses from users. I also created this to demonstrate the creation and use of C# variables. <br>
