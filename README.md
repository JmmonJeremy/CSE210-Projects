# General Overview of C# Code Demonstrations
I created this to demonstrate the use of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and C# integrated together. The C# code demonstrations are done by Jeremy Troy Suchanski. These demonstrations have been created to be a tool to help others learn code using the C# programming language.

# C# Software Projects Organization
### This repository contains C# code for several different software projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like. <br>
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments. <br>
#### &emsp; &emsp; Prep1

&emsp; &emsp; <ins> **Prep1 Overview** </ins> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; This is a basic question & response program using C#. I created this to demonstrate the use of the C# functions: Console.WriteLine() to print statements to the terminal and of Console.ReadLine() to capture responses from users. I also created this to demonstrate the creation and use of C# variables. <br>
